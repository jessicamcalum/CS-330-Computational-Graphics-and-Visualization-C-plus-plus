## 1.	How do I approach designing software?

### -	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? 

####    
  My work on this project helped to emphasize the advantages of writing modular and well-organized code. I was able to practice implementing modularized functions to help reduce redundant code.
  
### -	What design process did you follow for your project work?
  
####    For this particular project, I started by following the design of the code that was provided in the tutorials. I was able to easily modify that code structure to best fit my project’s needs. 

### -	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

####    In the future, I would approach my design a little differently. I would have liked to started modularizing my code, especially my shaders, from the beginning. I found it difficult and complicated to implement separate shader files towards the end of the project. 

## 2.	How do I approach developing programs?

### -	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

####    A new development strategy I used was creating a section of code at the beginning of the code where I could easily manipulate the attributes of the objects in the scene. This made the process of arranging and manipulating the objects much easier. I also was able to learn how to modularize functions that could create vertices and indices for shapes.

### -	How did iteration factor into your development?

####    Iteration was used in the functions that created the vertices and indices for the spheres and cylinders. I also used iteration when it came to manipulating objects in my scene. I would run the code, assess what needed adjustment/improvement, make the necessary modifications to the code, then repeat.

### -	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

####    Each milestone helped me to build upon my knowledge I had acquired in previous milestones. With each milestone, the knowledge I gained helped me to create code that was more modular and less redundant. I also made sure to include notes wherever I made changes.

## 3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

### -	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

####    This course allowed me to gain more experience with OpenGL and computer graphics. This was a great learning experience and I know that this experience will help me to create less redundant code in the future.

### -	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

####    The challenge I had in completing this project was the greatest thus far. I’m sure that working through the mistakes I made while completing this project has taught me a lot. Overall, I have gained knowledge that will serve as a solid foundation for my future learning.
